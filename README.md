This the new code 

**#1 #research**

I want to make mobile robot to transfer something from one place to another place with automatically.

I using E-puck in Webots simulation to perform the mobile robot. What we need in automatic mobile robot, they are :
**Sensor :** Encoder, This sensor will count the wheels movement, we can determine the robot movement distance ((dead recogning) for movement calculation).

**Camera :** Detect the environment using visual, to detect line using HLT (Hough Line Transform).

**Sensor Distance :** Detect something around the robot.

**Path Planing :** A* Path planing is path planing method for finding the shortest path for the robot archive the goal with counting the gain of each grid map then.
