This the new code 

**#1 #research**

I want to make mobile robot to transfer something from one place to another place with automatically.

I using E-puck in Webots simulation to perform the mobile robot. What we need in automatic mobile robot, they are :
**Sensor :** Encoder, This sensor will count the wheels movement, we can determine the robot movement distance ((dead recogning) for movement calculation).

**Camera :** Detect the environment using visual, to detect line using HLT (Hough Line Transform).

**Sensor Distance :** Detect something around the robot.

**Path Planing :** A* Path planing is path planing method for finding the shortest path for the robot archive the goal with counting the gain of each grid map then.


Rearrange the flow of code
