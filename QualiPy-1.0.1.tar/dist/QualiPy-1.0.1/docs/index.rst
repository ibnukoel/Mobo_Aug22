Welcome to QualiPy's documentation!
===============================================================

QualiPy is an open source Python library that provides filters for detecting images that have certain features. Currently QualiPy has over a dozen filters that can detect images that are e.g. blurred or overexposed. While developed primarily for photos found on Flickr, QualiPy can be used for any image. For a list of available filters, see :ref:`filters`.

For getting started, see :ref:`installation` and :ref:`examples`.
